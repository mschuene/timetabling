# Source code for my bachelors thesis on automatic timetabling via weighted partial max-sat (in german)

The thesis is written as a literal program using emacs org-mode and contained in the file timetabling.org
Time tables were created using the open-wbo solver and a clojure program to create the partial max-sat
instance based on scheduling constraints.
